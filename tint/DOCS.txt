    Attributes
    ----------
    params : dict
        Parameters for the tracking algorithm.

        FIELD_THRESH : units of 'field' attribute
            The threshold used for object detection. Detected objects are
            connnected pixels above this threshold.
        ISO_THRESH : units of 'field' attribute
            Used in isolated cell classification. Isolated cells must not be
            connected to any other cell by contiguous pixels above this
            threshold.
        ISO_SMOOTH : pixels
            Gaussian smoothing parameter in peak detection preprocessing. See
            single_max in tint.objects.
        MIN_SIZE : square kilometers
            The minimum size threshold in square kilometres for an object to be
            detected. See extract_grid_data in grid_utils.
        SEARCH_MARGIN : meters
            The radius of the search box around the predicted object center.
        FLOW_MARGIN : meters
            The margin size around the object extent on which to perform phase
            correlation.
        MAX_DISPARITY : float
            Maximum allowable disparity value. Larger disparity values are
            sent to LARGE_NUM.
        MAX_FLOW_MAG : meters per second
            Maximum allowable global shift magnitude. See get_global_shift in
            tint.phase_correlation.
        MAX_SHIFT_DISP : meters per second
            Maximum magnitude of difference in meters per second for
            two shifts to be considered in agreement.
            See correct_shift in tint.matching.
        GS_ALT : meters
            Altitude in meters at which to perform phase correlation for
            global shift calculation. See correct_shift in tint.matching.
        LEVELS : n x 2 numpy array, meters
            Each row represents range of vertical levels over which to
            identify objects. Objects will then by matched across the
            different vertical level ranges.
        TRACK_INTERVAL: integer
            Index i corresponding to the interval given in levels over
            which to track across time.
        BOUNDARY_GRID_CELLS: set
            Set of tuples of grid indices for the boundary of the in
            range area. Use empty set to ignore this test.
        UPDRAFT_THRESH: float, DbZ
            Threshold used when tracking local maxima across vertical levels
            in order to define "updrafts".
        UPDRAFT_START: float, metres
            Height at which to begin tracking updrafts.

    field : str
        String specifying pyart grid field to be used for tracking. Default is
        'reflectivity'.
    grid_size : array
        Array containing z, y, and x mesh size in meters respectively.
    last_grid : Grid
        Contains the most recent grid object tracked. This is used for dynamic
        updates.
    counter : Counter
        See Counter class in helpers.py.
    record : Record
        See Record class.
    current_objects : dict
        Contains information about objects in the current scan.
    tracks : DataFrame

    __saved_record : Record
        Deep copy of Record at the penultimate scan in the sequence. This and
        following 2 attributes used for link-up in dynamic updates.
    __saved_counter : Counter
        Deep copy of Counter.
    __saved_objects : dict
        Deep copy of current_objects.
